## Project Overview

The Faculty of Technology Mail Tracking System aims to streamline and enhance the process of managing and tracking physical mail within the faculty. This system consists of a web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and a mobile application developed using Flutter. The web application generates letters with unique QR codes using Crystal Reports, assigns authorities for the mail to pass through, and manages the overall workflow. The mobile application allows users to scan QR codes to verify the passage of mail through designated authorities. Docker is used for deployment to ensure scalability and manageability.

## Diagrams

### System Architecture

The system architecture diagram provides a high-level overview of the system's components and their interactions. This includes the presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, and integration layer.

### ER Diagrams

The entity-relationship (ER) diagrams show the database structure and the relationships between different entities.
